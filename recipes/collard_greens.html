    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 bunch collard greens</li>
      <li>4 thick slices bacon, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
      <li>4 cups water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
      <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>

        Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and
        select Saute function. Cook bacon until brown and crisp, about 5
        minutes. Turn off Saute function. Pour in water and vinegar. Scrape the
        bottom of the pot to release stuck bits of bacon. Add collard greens and
        stir to coat. Pour in chicken broth and season with salt. Close and lock
        the lid.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer
        for 5 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
      </li>
      <li>
        Release pressure using the natural-release method according to
        manufacturer's instructions for 20 minutes. Quick-release remaining
        steam, according to manufacturer's instructions, about 5 minutes. Unlock
        and remove the lid. Season with more salt if necessary.
